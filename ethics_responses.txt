PA6a — Ethics Responses
=======================

Instructions: Write your responses directly below each question.
There is no minimum or maximum length, but please be thoughtful and specific.


1. Defining Human Writing
   Perplexity measures how surprising a sequence of words is. By using this
   as a detection metric, we are effectively defining human creativity as
   unpredictability.

   1a) Do you think unpredictability captures something that resonates with
       your personal understanding of what makes writing human? Why or why not?

   YOUR RESPONSE:



   1b) Either way, who might be unfairly impacted by a tool that flags
       predictable prose as non-human?

   YOUR RESPONSE:



2. The Reward for Standardization
   Reflect on your own education.

   2a) Have you ever been encouraged or rewarded for adopting a highly
       structured, standard, or predictable writing style (e.g., for a
       standardized test or a specific rubric)?

   YOUR RESPONSE:



   2b) What tensions emerge when the writing style that earns academic
       success is also the style that AI detectors flag as suspicious?

   YOUR RESPONSE:



   2c) Should educators use these AI detector tools?

   YOUR RESPONSE:



   2d) What alternatives should educators consider if they are concerned
       about AI writing in classes meant to teach writing skills?

   YOUR RESPONSE:



3. The Incentive Loop
   As we increasingly use AI-based tools (like Grammarly or LLM editors)
   to "polish" our work, our writing naturally becomes more predictable.

   3a) What incentives does this create for different stakeholders
       (e.g., students, educators, institutions, etc.)?

   YOUR RESPONSE:



   3b) If detection becomes mathematically harder, what alternative
       frameworks might we need to think about academic integrity and the
       role of writing in learning?
